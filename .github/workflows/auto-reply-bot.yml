            *Answers to your questions will most often come from the community, from
            developers like yourself. You will, from time to time, find that Axis
            employees answers some of the questions, but this is not a guarantee.
            Think of the discussion forum as a complement to other support channels,
            not a replacement to any of them.*


            *If your question remains unanswered for a period of time, please revisit it to see whether
            it can be improved by following the guidelines listed in
            [Axis support guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/AxisCommunications/discussions/13).*
